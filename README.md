Event Plugin

In the Wordpress Setup just import the file and you can view it. Only logged in from admin can test it!

Phase 1: Constructing the Foundation

●	Event Creation:
●	Develop functionality for creating events through PHP. This includes defining event attributes such as name, date, location, and description.
●	Initially, create a few sample events to populate the system.

Phase 2: User Interface

●	Home Screen:
●	Display a list of events the user has booked with their current status.
●	Provide an option to view and book other available events.
●	Booking Form:
●	When booking an event, users should fill out a form capturing additional information (e.g., number of attendees, special requests).
●	Implement form validation to ensure data integrity.
 
Phase 3: Admin Panel

●	Booking Oversight:
●	Create an admin interface to view all bookings. Each booking should have options to approve or reject.
●	Approved or rejected bookings should update their status accordingly, visible on the user's home screen.
