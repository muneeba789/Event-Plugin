#Event Plugin

In the Wordpress Setup just import the file and you can view it. Only logged in from admin can test it!

**Phase 1: Constructing the Foundation**

**Event Creation:**
1. Develop functionality for creating events through PHP. This includes defining event attributes such as name, date, location, and description.
2. Initially, create a few sample events to populate the system.

**Phase 2: User Interface**

**Home Screen:**
1. Display a list of events the user has booked with their current status.
2. Provide an option to view and book other available events.

**Booking Form:**
1. When booking an event, users should fill out a form capturing additional information (e.g., number of attendees, special requests).
2. Implement form validation to ensure data integrity.
 
**Phase 3: Admin Panel**

**Booking Oversight:**
1. Create an admin interface to view all bookings. Each booking should have options to approve or reject.
2. Approved or rejected bookings should update their status accordingly, visible on the user's home screen.
